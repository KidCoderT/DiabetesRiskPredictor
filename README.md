# Diabetes Risk Predictor

This is a project that i started on friday 3rd of june for the Global initiative Field trip

> In brief, Global Innovation Field Trip (GIFT) is a 24-hour, live, on-line event where students in grades K to 12 can give 10 minute presentations about anything they have done involving innovation, invention and creativity. GIFTâ€™s are held 4 times a year and in 2 years have featured nearly 1,000 innovators from 51 countries giving almost 650 presentations on a wide variety of creative, new and innovative topics and projects. The next GIFT will be 16/17 July (Saturday/Sunday) and will be the greatest one yet!

And so for this event I wanted to participate to show on of my projets and recently I had started learning AI and ML programming and even though i only know the data field I thaught why not make a project that can predict wheter a person has diabetes or not.
And also on top of that I wanted it so that my project could predict how likely you are to get diabetes or increase the type from 1 to 2. This was my project idea and i had a month to work on it. THe final presentation is going to happen on my birthday july 16 and so now I have a little over a month to complete the project, prepare a ppt and also get ready for presentation.

So great Lets get to it. Ive already submitted the form for joining and so now all thats left is to continue on the project.

Also all the notes plans and more on the model im building and web app im making is in the main.py file
